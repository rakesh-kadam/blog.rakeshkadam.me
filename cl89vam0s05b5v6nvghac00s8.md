## Useful Docker Command

Docker is used to build, share and deploy containerized applications. 


In this post, Iâ€™ll share essential docker commands that will help you steer through the world of Docker. 

Refer to this [link](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline) for official documentation if you require additional optional along with below mentioned docker commands

**Docker Commands**
	
 List all running container 
```
$ docker ps 
```

List all running and stopped container
```
$ docker ps -a 
```

List all available docker images
```
$ docker images 
```

Download Image and/or Create a container 
```
$ docker run <image-name>:<image-tag> 
```

Download a docker image
```
$ docker pull <image-name>:<image-tag>
```
	
Append a command
```
$ docker run <image> bash
```

Execute a command
```
$ docker exec <contianer> cat /etc/hosts 
```

Detached mode (Runs in the background)
```
$ docker run -d <image-name> 
```

Attached mode

$ docker attach <contianer-id> 
```

Stop a container container
```
$ docker stop <container-id/name> 
```

Remove a docker container 
```
$ docker rm <contianer-id/name> 
```

Delete a docker image
```
$ docker rmi <image-id/name> 
```

Remove all unused containers, networks, images (both dangling and unreferenced), and optionally, volumes
```
$ docker system prune
```

Run interactive mode with terminal access 
```
$ docker run -it <image-name> 
```

Port mapping of docker host with container 
```
$ docker run -p <docker_host_port_number>:<container_port_number> <image-name> 
```

Volume mapping of docker host with container
```
$ docker run -v <docker_host_file_path>:<container_file_path> <image-name> 
```

Inspect docker container
```
$ docker inspect <contianer-id/name>
```

Check container logs
```
$ docker logs <contianer-id/name> 
```

**Note: **
- If you run a plain ubuntu image without any application in it the container will immediately exit as there would be no running process in it.
- You cannot add port mapping when the container is running
